# EasyWay FiboZZ Forex Trade Panel

This code is a sample implementation of the EasyWay FiboZZ Forex Trade Panel, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This trade panel provides advanced tools for manual trading in the forex market.

## How It Works

The code includes necessary libraries and defines constants for the maximum number of target levels and the panel dimensions. It also declares global variables for the trade panel and various chart objects.

The code then defines custom indicator functions for drawing ZigZag Extreme Arrows and Daily Fibonacci Extension levels. These functions are responsible for the logic of drawing these indicators on the chart.

In the initialization function `OnInit()`, the trade panel is created using the `CreatePanel()` function. If the panel creation fails, an error message is printed. The account information panel is added to the trade panel, and the custom indicators and customization options are also added. Labels are created to display important trading information on the chart.

The deinitialization function `OnDeinit()` removes the trade panel elements and deletes the labels.

In the main execution function `OnTick()`, the trading algorithm is executed. The specific details of the trading algorithm are not provided in this code.

The `Conclusion()` function is called to display the trade panel and execute the trading algorithm.
